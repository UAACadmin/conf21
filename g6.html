		    		<p>Online media are not merely virtual. The electricity demanded by the production and use of data centers, networks, and devices mainly powered by fossil fuels, has a real material impact on our Earth. Streaming media is calculated to account for over 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions and almost 4% of global energy usage. This rapidly rising figure is expanding the footprint of information and communication technology (ICT). The rise of CryptoArt, NFTs, and other blockchain-based activities also contribute to this unsustainable demand for electricity and resulting carbon emissions, to say nothing of the contributions of the average individual at home. As the COVID-19 global pandemic has forced an abrupt turn to remote teaching and learning, the reliance on streaming media for distance learning has entrenched students and instructors further in this massive environmental consumption. Our session examines the streaming dependency in fine and performing arts courses, modelled on our research team's one-year study on the carbon footprint of online teaching and learning. We critique the &quot;outsourcing&quot; to the future of streaming's environmental damage, explore sustainable models for course delivery, and share our research in developing small-file, sustainable media arts. Large file media are killing the planet. We explore the constraint of the small file as a creative environmental practice in teaching, learning, and creating in the arts.</p>

		    		<h3>G.6.1 <i>Rebound Effects in Streaming and Video Conferencing</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Laura U. Marks</strong><span class="school">, Simon Fraser University</span></p>
    				<p>This talk will explain the engineering science behind the carbon footprint of streaming video and videoconferencing. Information and communication technologies (ICT) help to save energy in some instances. However, both streaming video and videoconferencing are subject to rebound effects, whereby increased energy efficiency leads to greater consumption of a resource, and substitution effects, whereby other types of products are replaced by their digital equivalents. ICT as a whole uses almost 4% of global electricity &mdash; much more than the airline industry. This figure is rising alarmingly, propelled especially by online video. A number of ICT engineers calculate that streaming video is responsible for 1% to 1.3% of greenhouse gas emissions. I will explain how that electricity consumption is shared among networks, data centers, and consumer devices, and how, even though each of these is increasingly energy-efficient, that efficiency is outweighed by the increasing demand for high-speed data.</p>

		    		<h3>G.6.2 <i>Small-File Media Aesthetics and Politics</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Radek Przedpe≈Çski</strong><span class="school">, Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin</span></p>
    				<p>Small-file media are ecologically sustainable new media artworks under 5 megabytes in size and under 5 minutes in duration, promoted during <i>Small File Media Festival</i> founded by media scholar Laura U. Marks and hosted by the School for the Contemporary Arts at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver. The paper will examine small-file media both as an aesthetically pleasing &quot;green&quot; media format and an activist pedagogy aimed at drawing attention to the carbon footprint of streaming media, changing habits of media consumption and influencing policy. I am going to discuss the ways in which the festival and small-file media resonate with the framework of &quot;computing within limits&quot; proposed by ICT engineer Bonnie Nardi. The paper will be illustrated by examples of small-file media artworks, showcasing its diversity of methods, such as compression aesthetics, sound design, haptic entanglements or computational elegance.</p>

		    		<h3>G.6.3 <i>Video Entropy: Experiments with Small File Media Aesthetics</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>H&acirc;n Ph&#7841;m</strong><span class="school">, Simon Fraser University</span></p>
    				<p>In this presentation, filmmaker Han Pham will discuss the context, process, and creative strategies around her small-file experimental film Ng&agrave;y X&#7917;a Ng&agrave;y X&#432;a/Once Upon a Time (2020, 5 min, 5MB). Through sourcing and recontextualizing found footages &mdash; many of which are small-file in nature, the film weaves collectively sourced footage of Saigon, Vietnam, into a personal reality, acting as a site of mediation upon pastness and reality, traditional Vietnamese storytelling and digital spaces, and the person within the collective. Thinking through Deleuze's notion of fabulation and Pisters's idea of metallurgist filmmaking, this presentation will walk through how the film's strategies of relocations and abstraction of found footages open up aesthetic and political potentials to reinvent collective history and provide a spectral haven within filmic space. Furthermore, this presentation will also touch on the small-file reality of the film, discussing practical strategies of small-file footage collections and format compressions, as well as the challenges and artistic potentials they come with. In compressing and exporting a film with unconventional technical parameters (bit depth, frame rates, dimensions, etc.), the film shows how such unconventional data processing does not pose as constraints, but rather provides alternative artistic potentials and ways of thinking. Through the pixelation that occurred during the process, the coherent, transparent image gives way for the low-fi, broke down, entropy-charged image, allowing the digital medium to enact upon its own and facilitate artistic potentials to negate time and space within the film.</p>

		    		<h3>G.6.4 <i>Pushing Against the Substitution Effect: Best Practices for Carbon Neutral Streaming in Remote Teaching and Learning</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Stefan Smulovitz</strong><span class="school">, Simon Fraser University</span></p>
    				<p>Some may argue that online teaching will conserve energy, as teachers and students will not rely on transportation to get to the classroom. However, we argue that streaming media exemplifies the &quot;substitution effect&quot; of information and communication technology (ICT), where other types of products are replaced by their digital equivalents. In first-year survey courses across the continent, classes of up to 300 students or more stream their film content, lecture material, and videoconference for classroom discussion and repeat this in all of their classes, on top of the streaming they already do for leisure. The average internet usage of a North American individual who works and lives from home generates several hundred thousand grams of carbon per month. Driving this usage and its associating footprint is streaming video. We aim to make tangible the otherwise invisible impact of streaming, beginning with online teaching and learning. Our research team partnered with our university's sustainability office to examine the carbon footprint associated with the turn to remote teaching and learning. This talk shares data gathered from our collaborations with students, faculty and staff in the School for the Contemporary Arts at SFU and our partners in IT. Our aim is to address the specific technology needs of faculty and students in the arts and to share a best-practices guideline for videoconferencing and streaming in online teaching so to model solutions that minimize bandwidth.</p>
