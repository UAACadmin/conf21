		    		<p>At once sources of survival and destruction, of sustenance and danger, elements &mdash; broadly defined &mdash; have always been a point of fascination for artists and thinkers. This panel investigates how artists have represented, repurposed, and responded to elements, foregrounding their potential as materials, metaphors, mediums, archives, and frameworks. How, we ask, have aesthetic engagements with the elemental figured in our understanding of the world and our role in its transformation, especially in the context of settler colonialism, climate crisis, and geo/bio/necro-politics? What does elemental art tell us about temporality, endurance, disappearance, emergency, and disaster? How might we reimagine approaches to art history by thinking elementally and repositioning &mdash; or decentering &mdash; the human? This session features research by scholars working at the convergence of art, politics, and environment and across mediums, geographies, and time periods.</p>

		    		<h3>C.2.1 <i>Ice in Motion: Panoramic Perspectives and Moving Pictures</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Isabelle Gapp</strong><span class="school">, University of Toronto</span></p>
    				<p>The Arctic panorama has often been framed by conversations of the Victorian imperial imaginary and was originally conceived to showcase Anglophone exploration, heroism and settler colonialism. This paper explores the complementary and multifaceted visual representations of Arctic glacial ice, from the Victorian spectacle of the panorama to contemporary time-lapse photography and film. With this, I look at how glaciers have been depicted, documented and presented within panoramic media over the past two centuries. I draw particular attention to the work of Henry Aston Barker, Tyrone Martinsson, and James Balog as examples of how the panoramic image was used in its original form and subsequently adapted as a tool for communicating environmental change. This paper is not restricted by geographical or national concerns, but rather moves across landscapes around the Circumpolar North, from Svalbard to Alaska, and the ocean and seas in-between. I explore how ice moves through both time and space, confronting climate histories within physical and spatio-temporal ideas of movement. Alongside the materiality of ice, I consider the modes of observation involved in creating and viewing these panoramic pictures, from the rotunda at Leicester Square, London, to ships moving across drift-ice. This also recognizes the panorama as a form of entertainment, from the shock and awe of 'far-flung' lands to the spectacle of large-scale calving events. In making tangible and visual an Arctic environmental history, this paper does not simply seek to document ice loss, but instead looks to the panorama as a means of communicating ice as a substance, an aesthetic sublime, as an object of scientific study and as a symbol of climate change.</p>

		    		<h3>C.2.2 <i>Idiosyncratic Approach to the Physical Properties of Matter in Arcimboldo's Allegories</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Leman Berdeli</strong><span class="school">, Sapienza Universit&agrave; di Roma</span></p>
    				<p><i>The Four Seasons</i> is a set of oil paintings produced in 1563, 1572, and 1573 by Giuseppe Arcimboldo. He offered the set to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1569, accompanying <i>The Four Elements</i>, which were attempted to express the creation of harmony from chaos to form anthropomorphic godlike portraits praising Maximilian by suggesting that he is a ruler who controls even the four primal elements. Both series correspond analogously to each other as Fire to Summer and Water to Winter. This pairing creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the dynasty. The purpose of this study is to bring a different interpretation of depictions a scientific, metaphysical approach formed and placed on the tableau ground same as the interstellar matter formed by interstellar gas, dust, plasma, and dark matter.</p>

		    		<h3>C.2.3 <i>Carbon Copy: Jill Magid's Proposal</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Georgia Phillips-Amos</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
    				<p>In 2016, the American conceptual artist Jill Magid created a rough-cut 2.02-carat diamond from the exhumed ashes of the deceased Mexican architect Luis Barrag&aacute;n's body. Magid worked with a company that offers a chemical process allowing the extraction of carbon from human remains. Once siphoned, the carbon is exposed to extreme heat and pressure, which crystallize ashes into diamonds. With blessings from the architect's family, the artist had the diamond set in a wearable silver engagement ring and presented it as a proposal to the Swiss head of the Barrag&aacute;n Foundation, Federica Zanco. The foundation is notorious for carefully guarding the Barrag&aacute;n archive, going to lengths to censure reproduction of any images of the late architect's work and keeping original materials stowed in a private vault in Switzerland. Following a three-year-long epistolary and artistic negotiation with Zanco, and the institution that both protects and restricts his legacy, Magid hoped the ring might serve as a trading chip in exchange for greater access or as a prompt to have Barrag&aacute;n's work returned to Mexico. The artist is engaged in a near-decade-long portrait with an absent center. Though both Barrag&aacute;n and his oeuvre remain out of reach, Magid's material transformation of his remains shifts the narrative of his archive. By extension, the artist carves an opening to reconsider the ethics and legalities of any body of work held in private or institutional hands. This paper will explore how Magid's work raises elemental questions around the nature of extraction, preservation, restitution, and institutional control.</p>
