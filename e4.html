		    		<p>This roundtable explores Indigenous performance art and its longstanding role in asserting Indigenous sovereignties, embodying epistemologies, and activating methodologies. Centralizing Indigenous ways of knowing and being, here, performance is considered in relation to land, languages, and materialities as well as to human and non-human kinships and treaty-based relationships. Currently, resurgences of Indigenous cultural knowledges are affirming further connections between performance and making, materialities and storytelling, embodied practice and mapping, for instance. The curation of Indigenous performance art highlights its role to histories of resistance, institutional critique, and collaboration while also providing opportunities for curators to work independently outside of institutions in public spaces. Grounded in practices of visiting, this roundtable welcomes and encourages a range of approaches and methods to sharing knowledges, including critical engagements and responses in the form of short papers and performances to performative actions and poetic/sound gestures.</p>

		    		<h3>E.4.1 <i>Go-won-go Mohawk: Queering the Wild West</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Michelle McGeough</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
    				<p>Go-won-go Mohawk was, by all accounts, a larger-than-life persona(s) who seemed to defy labels of any kind. Her &quot;troubling gender&quot; performances were, for the most part, confined to the vaudeville stages of North America and Europe. As the first Native American playwright, Go-won-go's life and the retailing of it is an example of what Scott Lyons refers to as &quot;rhetorical sovereignty,&quot; the inherent right and ability of peoples to determine their own communicative needs and desires in this pursuit, to decide for themselves the goals, modes, styles, and languages of public discourse&quot; (241). In plying her craft, Go-won-go Mohawk brought into the realm of public discourse a construction of Native American masculinity that differed from popular stereotypes. In her stage performances as the Native American male protagonist in the plays <i>Wep-Ton-No Mah</i>, <i>The Indian Mail Carrier</i>, and <i>The Flaming Arrow</i>, she did not portray Native Americans as victims but as the heroes. While Go-won-go deflected the politics of recognition for her own ends, she also engaged in the ongoing struggle for recognition and justice by Native Americans at the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Tanya Lukin Linklater</strong><span class="school">, Queen's University</span></p>
    				<p>Tanya Lukin Linklater's performance will work through orality and embodiment &mdash; investigating histories of Indigenous peoples' lives, lands, and structures of sustenance. She proposes to investigate insistence in both concept and application. This performative work draws from her production of performances with dancers, composers, musicians and poets, in relation to the architecture of museums, objects in exhibition, scores, and cultural belongings.</p>

		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Peter Morin</strong><span class="school">, Tahltan Nation/OCAD University</span></p>
    				<p>This is a gesturing through a force of silences. The performance artist as a maker, along with their future descendants, stand in defiance of how difficult political histories are performed within anthropological texts examining Indigenous knowledge, institutional structures and how those structures attempt to undermine cultural strategies for remembering. In 1903 anthropologist James Teit made several trips to Tahltan Territory, specifically to gather/document/capture Tahltan knowledge and material culture as his career builder. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tahltan performance artist and scholar Peter Morin revisited these Teit produced texts via Facebook Live. Over a series of 7 hours, Morin re-voiced these older Tahltan stories and offered connection to the breath of the original storytellers. For this performance offering, Morin moves further in by designing gestures to critically interrogate the use of the English language throughout the Teit version of Tahltan stories and his attempt to wipe away Tahltan expressions. Morin is looking to develop a Tahltan gestural language in order to honour the original knowledges that live underneath and in the spaces between Teit's English words.</p>

    			<div class="col s12 m8 offset-m4 l5 offset-l6">
    				<p class="bio"><strong>Peter Morin</strong> is a grandson of Tahltan ancestor artists. He has now lived away from his home territory for most of his life, but like his ancestors who have walked on the land, he carries Tahltan knowledge, ideas and history with him wherever he is. Every step along the way, Tahltan knowledge has guided his researching, dreaming, learning, making of the past twenty years of artistic and curatorial practice. Morin began art school in 1997, completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver in 2001 and his Master's in Fine Arts in 2010 at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan. Initially trained in lithography, Morin's artistic practice moves from printmaking to poetry to drum-making to button blanket making to installation to beadwork to performance art.</p>

		    		<h3>E.4.4 <i>Dancing Sovereignty</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Mique'l Dangeli</strong><span class="school">, Git Hayetsk Dancers/'Na Aksa Gyila&#817;k'yoo School/University of Northern British Columbia</span></p>
    				<p>The fundamental connection between protocol and First Nations dance practiced on the Northwest Coast is that protocol governs both the right to perform songs and dances and how performances occur. These rights, which are primarily hereditary, are expressed through oratory in terms of ownership and permission at the time of the performance. Rights to songs, dances, masks, headdresses, robes, and other ceremonial privileges, are vehemently guarded as they are not only integral to individual and collective identity, but they also define ownership of territories. As such, the ways in which Northwest Coast First Nations dance artists assert, negotiate, and enact protocol governing rights to songs and dances during performances is entrenched in local politics &mdash; family, clan, community, and Nation. All of which inform how their work engages with provincial, national, and international politics. In my presentation, I examine the role that protocol plays in the work of Northwest Coast First Nations dance artists and argue that it is foundational to our creative process. Protocol is often deemed as inflexibility of Northwest Coast First Nation dance practices. However, drawn from my embodied research as a life-long dancer as well as a teacher of Tsimshian First Nation dance, and a leader of the Git Hayetsk, I argue that dance artists and their dance groups deploy protocol in strategic and dynamic ways that are responsive to diverse performative, social, and political demands. The central argument of this presentation and my larger body of research is that protocol constitutes much more than the boundaries of their artistic practice. It is the creative lens through which First Nations dance artists, and their dance groups, enact dancing sovereignty. Dancing sovereignty is the theoretical framework I created to critically engage with the ways in which sovereignty is embodied in Northwest Coast First Nations dance practices through complex negotiations and responsive assertions of the protocol. I define dancing sovereignty as self-determination carried out through the creation of performances that adhere to and expand upon protocol in ways that affirms hereditary privileges and territorial rights among diverse audiences and collaborators. These assertions of sovereignty are not moored to Western legal definitions; rather, they are articulated through Indigenous nationhood and the protocol and epistemologies thereof.</p>
