		    		<p>This roundtable invites artists, arts administrators, arts workers, students, and scholars whose work examines stasis within institutional protocols of cultural spaces such as universities, museums, and art galleries. Reflecting on a recent workshop that used counter-mapping as part of a public consultation process in a phased redesign project for the Confederation Centre for the Arts in Prince Edward Island, this round-table will foreground collaborative methodologies that invite embodied, dissonant, and multivocal accounts of public arts spaces. Participants will be encouraged to share their strategies of intervention within institutions and to discuss the challenges and limitations of facilitating these conversations. What does it mean to participate in the renewal and renovation process of such institutions? What are the ethical parameters and obligations of participation?</p>

Their current work explores how queer and trans* lives, bodies, and histories navigate institutional lines, with special attention to the complicities of queer liberation within settler colonialism. They use methods of participation, collaborative practice, and research-creation to examine queer memory-keeping activities, this term referring to a spectrum of activities from DIY community-based engagements that resist documentation to the 21st century's institutional Queer Museum.

		    		<h3>B.7.1 <i>Participatory Art Crisscrossing: The University, the Art Museum, and the US/Mexico Border</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>MR Barnadas</strong><span class="school">, Independent Artist</span></p>
    				<p>Social Practice artists and Collective Magpie founders Tae Hwang and MR Barnadas were invited by the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego 2016â€“18 to participate in an artist-led experiment to invent new ways of engaging diverse audiences both within the museum and in the surrounding regional communities. This paper presents our response as artists with the creation of the <i>Transnational Seminar I & II</i> as both institutional critique and institutional collaboration; along with its ethics of production, methodologies used, and the ensuing challenges, successes, and failures.</p>
					<p>Context: As residents of the borderlands of San Diego-Tijuana, we witnessed xenophobia, anti-Mexican sentiment and observed resulting harm to our communities from the scale of microaggressions to segregation to overt racism as an ongoing challenge that intensified exponentially during these years.</p> 
					<p>Museum: The host institution, MCASD, has a mandate to serve the binational constituency of the region that we felt could be more aggressively pursued. As such, as artists, we utilized our temporary partnership with the museum as an opportunity to present counternarratives from local binational residents within a public art series and hosted solo-exhibition to bring visibility to the complex ways diversity is understood by the local public and to help expand the institution's own awareness of that nuance.</p> 
					<p>Universities/Colleges across the border: Local colleges similarly have missions to serve the greater borderlands region. We utilized our role as college educators to create experimental accredited courses that interested students applied to from colleges in both San Diego and Tijuana. Those students became the participants of the <i>Transnational Seminars</i> and worked collaboratively with us to create the public art interventions in both cities informed by their lived experiences and time spent working together. The 27-week seminar series was held weekly with participants crossing the US/MX Border and convening as a nomadic studio across both cities.</p>
