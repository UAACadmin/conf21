		    		<p>Michelle Caswell and Marika Cifor destabilize and denaturalize the idea of the neutrality of the archive when they position the archivist as caregiver, with <i>"affective responsibilities"</i> (36–38). Once understood to be objective, resolute, and determinative, archives have long been central to art historical methodologies. That is, until all those excluded from the historical record started to speak up loudly from the dustbin of history, not quite swept away after all. Today, standing at the edge of a multitude of 21stC disasters, art history has turned to interrogating its own methodologies in an effort to do things differently; to enact new ways of being. This panel invites participants to consider how feminist methodological, epistemological, and political changes have transformed "the archive" and how archival studies are understood and/or used in visual arts-based research. The organizers also welcome submissions from artists engaged in archival research and practices, papers on relevant case studies, and/or proposals from scholars or artists that discuss emerging or alternate archival forms or collections.</p>

She is an artist and scholar who rejects specialization in favour of transdisciplinary engagements with fine arts, art history, critical geography, urban studies, and politics. Modigliani's projects arise from a network of concerns, including the history of the avant-garde and its relationship to political critique, feminist art and writing, social dissent since 1968, the history of photography, performance and re-enactment as political strategy, and the pernicious effects of neoliberal capitalism. At the node of these networks is her central concern with how an individual's freedom of expression is destroyed, curtailed, or displaced through socio-economic factors beyond their control. Modigliani's artwork has been exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Museum (Philadelphia), Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (San Francisco), Colby College Museum of Art (Waterville, ME), the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia (Halifax), amongst other places. Her critical writing can be found in many academic journals and magazines and her first book, <i>Engendering an Avant-Garde: The Unsettled Landscapes of Vancouver Photo-Conceptualism</i>, was published by Manchester University Press's Rethinking Art's Histories series in 2018.

		    		<h3>B.2.1 <i>Looking for Queer Designers in All the Wrong Places</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Olivier Vallerand</strong><span class="school">, Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al</span></p>
    				<p>Thinking about the relation of gender, sexuality, and spatial design requires understanding both the use and experience of space and the approaches taken by designers. But because design and architecture archives often erase biographical elements about both designers and users to focus on building-related artefacts, it becomes difficult to develop comprehensive histories that address how the self-identifications of designers intersect with the social and political life of spaces. This is particularly problematic when exploring designers that have been consistently marginalized or pushed out of architecture and design histories. In a project focused on double and triple discriminations experienced by queer women in architecture &mdash; and in my broader research on queer space &mdash; I ran into the dual problem of trying to identify these women in archives and of trying to discuss the sexual orientation or gender identity of designers who might not have been explicit about it during their career, often fearing to lose the little business they were already struggling to get in a male-dominated profession.</p>
					<p>While believing strongly in the importance of making these figures visible, I have also dealt with the ethical questions that come with discussing designers' biographical details, addressed in this paper. How much can be inferred from limited personal archival material? Does it matter if architects' or designers' personal lives are discussed in terms that they might not have used themselves? Who gets to decide if these details matter or not to an understanding of the spaces they designed? And going back to the methodological issues of finding them in limited archives, is it even useful to use traditional design archives to trace such histories, or should other forms of archives be mined for their potential for design history research.</p>

		    		<ul>
		    			<li class="participants"><strong>Laurel McLaughlin</strong><span class="school">, Bryn Mawr College</span></li>

		    		</ul>
		    		<br/>	
    				<p>Chicana feminist and queer theorist Gloria Anzald&uacute;a wrote in <i>Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza</i> (1987), &quot;The US-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds.&quot; Through this quote, Anzald&uacute;a identifies the borderspace as a zone of abject bodily accrual, a kind of fleshly archive. Multidisciplinary artist Emilio Rojas draws upon Anzald&uacute;a's archive in the Benson Latin American Center of the University of Texas in Austin, alongside autobiographical experiences, to perform such fleshly encounters with, around, and of the US-Mexican border. Whether tattooing its outline down his spine annually in <i>Heridas Abiertas</i> (2017&ndash;ongoing); or growing corns, beans, and squash, in a 100-foot organic wall replica of the border activated by whispered border pedagogies from Anzald&uacute;a archive transparencies in <i>Naturalized Borders (to Gloria)</i> (2019); or inviting audiences to draw the border in exchange for a paleta (Mexican frozen treat), only to realize they cannot recollect its abstracted nature in <i>A Vague and Undetermined Place (to Gloria)</i> (2019), Rojas incarnates the border as affective catharsis.</p>
					<p>In a co-presented paper, McLaughlin and Rojas query these works and the artist's ongoing artist-based research in Anzald&uacute;a's archive within the context of a recent survey exhibition <i>Emilio Rojas: Tracing a Wound through My Body</i>, at Lafayette College, September 2&ndash;November 13, 2021. Notably, they explore how these performance and social practice works draw upon an embodied autobiographical and feminist understanding of the archive via Anzald&uacute;a and a recognition of a queer retroactive temporality, akin to what Elizabeth Freeman calls &quot;temporal drag,&quot; or a counter- or antisystematic history. In so doing, they ultimately examine how the open wound exists across time and perhaps offers a bridge to healing.</p>

		    		<h3>B.2.3 <i>Archival (W)holes: Exploring Posters with Glitter Issues</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Jessica Lapp</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
    				<p>This paper explores the Newberry Library's Chicago Protest Collection and its &quot;posters with glitter issues,&quot; that is, posters collected from recent Chicago protest actions that have been classified by conservation concern due to the amount of glitter and glue used in their construction. The Newberry's collection of modern protest materials is a unique and, at times, contradictory archival body. What allows these materials to hang together is their glitter proximity; how they shed, spread, accumulate, and intermingle in the stacks. Drawing from in-situ research at the Newberry, as well as interviews with Newberry archivists and an artist creating textiles in response to queer archival absence, this paper &quot;follows the glitter&quot; (Coleman 2020) in order to position feminist and queer archival records as transgressive and leaky. Thinking alongside archival theorizing on the archival body, and feminist and queer studies of glitter as world-building, I trace and corral glitter across four distinct, but interpolated acts of records shaping that constitute the Newberry Library's collection of protest materials: Initial inscription, collective constitution, institutional archivalization, and artistic use. In undertaking this analysis, I demonstrate how this bright and glittery archival body continually creates, sustains, obscures, and fabulates feminist and queer life worlds.</p>
