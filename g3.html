		    		<p>A recent special issue of the journal <i>Home Cultures</i> devoted to alternative domesticities concluded by asking for more research on domestic pluralities. In answering that call to action, we seek papers and accounts of artistic or curatorial practice that rethink the domestic normative by considering the intersectional, the transitional, and the in-between. Deploying such lenses as sexuality, race, ethnicity, and colonialism, this panel seeks to destabilize dominant views and narrow perspectives by exploring multiple experiences of the home. We ask: how does the design and materiality of the home mediate power relationships, kinship, friendship, intimacy, sexuality, and identity formation? Topics to explore could include: the LGBTQ home; the home and colonization; homelessness and housing insecurity; migration, displacement, and temporary homes such as tent cities and refugee camps; nature cultures such as pets, pests, and gardens; placemaking.</p>

		    		<h3>G.3.1 <i>The Early Modern Dutch Dollhouse as a Site of Knowledge-Making</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Michelle Moseley-Christian</strong><span class="school">, Virginia Tech</span></p>
    				<p>The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a watershed in which the Dutch household was formally recognized as a defined space that merited attention in guide books, presaged by early cookbooks as harbingers of this genre. A rise in texts aimed at the functional and aesthetic aspects of the domestic realm, starting with cookbooks, speaks to an emerging view of the home as a realm in need of a distinct set of rules and guidelines in order to appropriately manage it. Texts on housekeeping were, like conduct books, in line with class and religious expectations in the early modern Netherlands. Indeed, the rise of housekeeping texts amounts to a new variety of conduct books aimed simultaneously at home with a focus on the women in it. This study offers a deeper analysis of the collection, materiality, and display of seventeenth-and-eighteenth-century Dutch dollhouses through the prism of household management texts. The dollhouses themselves were lavish miniature households made of luxury materials, kept in cabinets that were bought, owned, and displayed by middle-class women in Dutch households. I argue that the early modern Dutch dollhouse was part of larger epistemic networks in which these collections constituted a form of sophisticated knowledge-making by women akin to, and informed by, household management, cookery, and conduct texts. With the exception of a few women, such as Agneta Block and Maria Sibylla Merian, women have been shut out of the study of early modern Netherlandish knowledge networks at this time. Contrary to this, dollhouses suggest that it is not women who are lacking in terms of engagement with wider information systems; rather, by widening an understanding of scholarly approaches to knowledge production, the participation and contributions of women in this area come into clearer focus.</p>

		    		<h3>G.3.2 <i>Living Arrangements: Omega Flowers and Bloomsbury's Expansive Domesticities</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Alison Syme</strong><span class="school">, University of Toronto</span></p>
    				<p>Christopher Reed's foundational work on Bloomsbury's &quot;domestic modernism&quot; established the group's interiors as intimately connected to their political resistance and alternative modes of living. Many aspects of Bloomsbury rooms, including the furnishings produced by the Omega Workshops &mdash; the Post-Impressionist home decoration firm set up by Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell, and Duncan Grant in 1913 &mdash; have received scholarly commentary, some of it focused on the artists' and clients' negotiation of sex and gender norms. Little attention, however, has been paid to the artificial flowers that Bell and others produced for the Omega. Radically simplified and inventive compared to Victorian precedents focused on verisimilitude, these blossoms blurred the line between painting, sculpture, and handicraft. No examples appear to have survived, but they are represented in identifiable domestic settings in numerous works by Bell, Grant, and Fry that reveal the flowers were created in a great variety of shapes and palettes, and were valued emblems of the artists' new interior design. In this paper, I argue that the Omega flowers were particularly effective catalysts for place-making and -imagining. Through their suggestive forms and novel arrangements, the Bloomsbury artists negotiated the legacies of Victorian domesticity and empire to fashion new ontological and emotive possibilities. By closely analyzing several works in which the flowers allude to and seemingly materialize diverse histories, elements, and geographies, I suggest that the bouquets created shifting terrains in which inherited hierarchies and clear distinctions between interior and exterior become undone, enabling more inclusive lived and imaginary relations.</p>

		    		<h3>G.3.3 <i>Sensitive Design: Robert de Montesquiou's Sensorial Interiors and its Stigmatisation</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Benoit Beaulieu</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
    				<p>&quot;So sensitive is his soul that a pale green melody will make him swoon with emotion; the touch of a velvet-leafed flower will send him into ecstasies. He must be attuned with vague perfumes, with harmonies of colors.&quot; It is in these words that the French count Robert de Montesquiou (1855&ndash;1921) was described in the newspaper <i>North American Philadelphia</i>. This citation highlights the distinctive aspect of the critiques against de Montesquiou, the focus on his hypersensitivity nearing the disease. To better understand the intersection of sensitivity and decadence in the condemnation of queerness, this presentation will focus on de Montesquiou's first interiors as it made him (in)famous.</p> 
					<p>The queer interior developed by de Montesquiou is explored through its stigmatization that took the form of the pathologization of hypersensitivity. Understood as a liminal space, de Montesquiou's apartment was at the margin of the familial home, in its attic. Locus of his identity formation, the apartment was a site of escapism and inspiration. The solicitation of the senses elevated the interior decoration and offered an alternative way of living, of inhabiting the domestic space. A variety of pictures of de Montesquiou's interiors will illustrate the presentation and will be combined with citations from newspapers and medical treatises. The presentation sheds light on an alternative form of modernism, one that is sensual, ornamental, queer. As a strategy of legitimation, de Montesquiou developed an original idea of the interior as therapeutic. Through this specific case study, this presentation aims to offer a better understanding of the role the senses played in the condemnation of queer lifestyles, as well as offering a recognition of queer agency and strategies of affirmation.</p>
