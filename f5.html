		    		<p>&quot;The smooth is the signature of the present time. It connects the sculptures of Jeff Koons, iPhones and Brazilian waxing&quot; (Byung-Chul Han, Saving Beauty). Contemporary cultural theorist Byung-Chul Han is known for his concise and accessible books. Through the relatively recent influx of English translations, his ideas have become a significant part of recent inquiries about ideas and practices that define life in the digital world. Looking at the consequences of social and technological changes, Han questions basic assumptions about the choices we make and the type of world we believe we are living in. This panel invites papers that use Han's ideas to interrogate and explore aspects of contemporary art, understood globally. Possible topics include, but are not limited to, papers that take up his core concepts: the smooth, transparency, excess positivity, the achievement-subject, good entertainment.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.1 <i>Reification: Between Museumization and Pornography</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Jessica Ragazzini</strong><span class="school">, Universit&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec en Outaouais/Universit&eacute; Paris Nanterre</span></p>
    				<p>The book <i>Le D&eacute;sir: Ou l'enfer de l'identique</i>, is a must for research on the theme of the double. The double is studied by Han in a relatively broad sense. Limiting ourselves to the question of the doubling of the body in photography and performance, this paper will aim to reflect on the impact of Byung-Chul Han's theories in relation to hyper-visibility. Indeed, from page 59 of his book, the philosopher makes a comparison between the exhibition of the reified living body in pornography and museum presentations. If this comparison seems surprising, consider the museum&rsquo;s exposed bodies that become objects of art by performance and the photographic act. In a comparable way, pornography exposes bodies as objects of consumption by photographic or filmic exposure. In the two cases, the hyper-visibility split the living bodies to transform them in the artifact, which exists only for the glance of others. This monstration is produced by the human hand holding the camera and broadcasting these images. The simulacrum is proposed in a continuous visibility that the viewer can appropriate as he wishes. Today, becoming an object is no longer simply an artistic question. Referring to the words of Barthes and Kafka, Han points out that the digital window has generated a daily reification through hyper-visibility. The other side of the coin is the simultaneous creation of a disinterest in the flesh that no longer needs to be fantasized; its double has now replaced it. The proposed communication will be organized in two parts; it will first consider Han's remarks on the question of the bodily double and then study its forms of hyper-visibility in the museum space, in pornography, and on social networks.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.2 <i>Hypervolition: Our Sacrifice of Choice</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Jevonne Peters</strong><span class="school">, Western University</span></p>
    				<p>Advanced segmentation and customization (called hyper-personalization) are often touted as the future of experiential marketing, and comes in the form of personalized experiences, tailored search results, and recommendations on what to do based on past behaviour and traits. The personalization is achieved through the deployment of algorithms that observe us and extract scraped information to abstract what it deems to be relevant. Byung Chul Han describes what we are experiencing as an &quot;aperspectival panopticon,&quot; in that the surveillance is no longer from a central location, but is omnipresent. Issues of interest include what is considered normal and who determines it, the effects of the mass adoption of these technologies, the corruption of algorithms by capital, and the subtle control on the various levels of collectivism within societies. This research critically examines our relationship with technology, our tendencies to customize experiences for ourselves, and introduces a new term, hypervolition, which is defined as the inability of consciousness to distinguish our true desires and choices, from our algorithmically deduced and imposed desires and choices. I define the Jevinian orders and phases related to the term, which extends Foucault's concept of disciplinary power, and Han's ideas on the neuronal within the framework of Jean Baudrillard's hyperreal. I also express the concepts through the artworks <i>My.o.T</i>, <i>Inter Alia</i>, <i>In Plain Sight</i>, and <i>The Resistance</i> that attempt to creatively immerse a viewer in the ideas.</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.3 <i>Representations of Imagery: An Analysis of Byung-Chul Han's &quot;Smooth Image&quot; and Hito Steyerl's &quot;Poor Image&quot;</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Elyse Longair</strong><span class="school">, Queen's University</span></p>
    				<p>Representations of imagery will lead us through society's development and understanding of images. It is important to recognize the impacts of the Internet and the barrage of visual language on our perceptions of reality, specifically, how screen culture has shaped the way we are not only linked to images, but define the experience, meaning, and beauty through our understanding of what images are, and can be. For Guy Debord, in <i>The Society of The Spectacle</i>, the essential question is &quot;What is an image?&quot; Which in turn is defined as &quot;The spectacle is capital accumulated to the point that it becomes images&quot; (17). Key theorists Hito Steyerl and Byung-Chul Han extend Debord's examination of the image into our post-internet world. Steyerl suggests, within <i>In Defense of The Poor Image</i>, that the poor image, emerging through the acceleration and deterioration of images online, creates a new value and hierarchic scale to view images. In <i>Saving Beauty</i>, Han questions our obsession with the hyper positivity of the smooth image, reinforced and perpetuated through &quot;liking&quot; images with a push of a button. If an image at its most basic level is a representation, what do the smooth image and poor image represent?</p>

		    		<h3>F.5.4 <i>To Be Discarded with Regards: Rethinking Foucault's &quot;The Technology of The Self&quot; with Han's &quot;The Aesthetic of The Smooth&quot; and Contemplative Lingering</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Lingxiang Wu</strong><span class="school">, Independent Artist</span></p>
    				<p>Today's digital communication platform performs like a giant meat market within the phantom of Neoliberal capitalism. Visual content is stripped naked to accelerate information exchange, thus stimulating instantaneous gratification of desire, even artworks. Yet, we feel more satisfied while walking alone in a park instead of scrolling online with the rest of the world. In response to the transformation of our global socio-economic landscape in the 1980s, Mitchell Foucault once asked, &quot;What are we in our actuality?&quot; Amongst the rapid advancement of contemporary digital technology and our everyday engagement with social media, it is dire for us to revisit his question. Using Instagram as a subject, this paper investigates the entanglement between the self and the algorithmic reflection of the self. Through Byung-Chul Han's critique on contemporary digital communication, this paper examines how Foucault's concept of the &quot;Technology of the self&quot; is challenged by Han's articulation on &quot;transparency&quot; and &quot;the aesthetic of the smooth.&quot; The disappearing of the self is the result of drowning in the endless cycle of overproduction and overconsumption orchestrated through the exploitation of the self. The fatigued knowledge of the self translates to a lack of substance and resonance in trending digital content such as Fluid art. However, art still possesses the ability to create intermissions from consumption instead of feeding into it. In the ongoing project Digital Landfill, artistic methods like collage and rotoscope make way for detours in visual communication. The play of seduction manifests the possibility of creating a digital place free of the capitalist urge to perform. As a reflection on the project, the paper emphasizes the need for contemplative digital spaces to release us from the agitated state and reestablish the technology of the self as a defence mechanism.</p>

Through experimentation with various mediums such as photographic collage, video, animation, and installation, Wu is interested in using artistic methods as visual detours. Re-imagining the digital/urban space into a dynamic visual experience where viewers can look into and dwell within, encouraging the moments of contemplative lingering.</p>
