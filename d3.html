		    		<p>Taking the relationship between horror cinema and contemporary art as a point of departure, this double panel session explores the porous interstice at the intersection of horror theory, art theory, and art criticism. Specifically looking to the ways in which horror tropes such as the return of the repressed, the uncanny, misrecognition, spectralisation, possession, and dispossession, as well as the transgression of borders and boundaries resonate with the post- and the de-colonial, this session invites reflections on the shared aesthetic, structural, and conceptual strategies between art and horror. It asks: What can be said of the profound influence of horror cinema on contemporary art and artistic practices? Can horror be conceived of as a theoretical perspective? Can horror aid in reassessing how museums, galleries, and universities research, collect, exhibit, and teach? Presenters will explore these questions as they relate to research practices, film and moving image art, exhibition, and more.</p>

		    		<h3>D.3.1 <i>Surrealism and Horror</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Julian Jason Haladyn</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
    				<p>In the infamous opening scene of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Salvador Dal&iacute;'s 1929 <i>Un chien andalou</i>, we witness the slashing of an eyeball, a scene of horror that locates this Surrealist film within the larger genre of horror cinema. Yet this is not an isolated manifestation of violence within practices of Surrealism but rather part of a larger exploration of unconscious impulses and imaginings, of violence and fantasies, of confrontations with &quot;otherness.&quot; Much of the existing scholarship on Surrealism and horror focuses on film. However, questions of horror permeate virtually all aspects of the Surrealist project, from Hans Bellmer's grotesque images of dolls to Maya Deren's uncanny doubles, from Mayo's bent and broken bodies to, in the words of Aime Cesaire, &quot;the original terror and fervour&quot; of Wifredo Lam's abstracted bodily forms &mdash; an approach that Lam himself referred to as &quot;an act of decolonization.&quot; This paper discusses the role of horror in Surrealist art, understood in an extended sense of the movement and spirit of Surrealism. Specifically, I will examine ways in which images and ideas of horror are used by a series of Surrealist artists to explore what is a vital terrain of the Surreal, which is grounded in questions of the unconscious and of &quot;otherness&quot; as a means of challenging and expanding notions of the &quot;real.&quot;</p>

		    		<h3>D.3.2 <i>Otto P&auml;cht and Horror Art History</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Maxwell Hyett</strong><span class="school">, Western University</span></p>
    				<p>In David Peak's philosophical and speculative investigation of horror, <i>The Spectacle of the Void</i>, he presents horror primarily as a problem of communication. Horror circumscribes the articulable limits of consciousness as a form of &quot;post-communication,&quot; or thinking without language, and &quot;extra-dimensionality,&quot; or consciousness beyond comprehension. In this sense, horror describes a clarity that always fails to exist simultaneously in perception and language; it is either &quot;inarticulable lucidity&quot; or &quot;articulate confusion.&quot;</p>
						<p>Speculating on the possible significance of horror's problem in communication for art historical methods, this presentation will attempt to imagine a horror art history by reading art historian Otto P&auml;cht through Peak's notion of horror. In P&auml;cht's inter-war critique of art historical writing, there exist two extremes: overly poetic and overly scientific investigations of the art object, both of which fall short of communicating the essential character of an artwork. Instead, P&auml;cht argues for art historical writing that forsakes formal and contextual elements in favour of communicating the emotional content and artistic will inherent to a given artwork. In this way, P&auml;cht suggests believing in an artwork in such a way that is not mimetic but world-defining, world-creating, and world-destroying. This proposes a fragile reality susceptible to post-communication and extra-dimensional movements. This presentation will speculate on the horror of a flexible reality gaping behind calcifying, articulable art historical projections as a potentially viable way for reassessing art historical methodologies.</p>
