		    		<p>This two-part session aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue between scholars in all fields working on the historical and contemporary problem of photographic knowledge. We have sought proposals stemming from the history of photography, art history, the visual arts, sociology, aesthetics, anthropology, visual studies, cultural studies, and communications, or somewhere in between. Our focus has been on two sites of photographic knowledge, namely, studios, and networks.</p>
					<p>Spaces of creation, the studio and researcher's cabinet/study, are increasingly present in exhibitions and publications, as both scholars and publics become curious about the life of the mind and the material culture behind the scenes. The studio is a space of situated and socializing knowledge, offering both intimacy and exposure to works-in-progress. In the vein of &quot;exploding cinema,&quot; we are interested in the &quot;atelier &eacute;clat&eacute;,&quot; but we are also looking at the photographic historian's spaces of communication &mdash; the book, the slide lecture, the conference, etc. &mdash; as &quot;epistemological studios.&quot;</p>
					<p>Network thinking has been reshaping art and photography history through biographical methods (&quot;object-lives&quot;) and institutional recasting in terms of national and global circulation. Under current conditions of impactful social networking, we are particularly interested in relational studies of reality effects and photographic truth claims. The session, therefore, considers projects that have brought studios and/or networks to life, and particularly those that complicate current methodologies or ways of thinking about photography's epistemic privilege.</p>

		    		<h3>F.3.1 <i>Lustrum/Contrejour: Photobook and the Transatlantic Network of Post-68 Photography</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Anton Lee</strong><span class="school">, University of British Columbia</span></p>
    				<p>This paper examines the importance of the photobook as an epistemological device, through which a new understanding of the photographic representation can be materialized and shared in different communities. I will focus in particular on the transatlantic exchange of influence between the American photographer Ralph Gibson and the group of French photographers and critics led by Claude Nori during the 1970s and 1980s. They interacted with one another not only in artistic and intellectual levels, but more importantly, through specifically material and institutional endeavours. This was due in large measure to their mutual interest in the transgressive potentialities of self-publishing and photographic sequencing.</p>
					<p>Gibson founded the independent publishing house Lustrum Press in 1970 in New York City, which in turn became the model for the gallery-cum-publisher Contrejour opened by Nori in 1975 in Paris. Gibson's method of poetic sequencing garnered serious attention in France immediately after the publication of his first photobook, <i>The Somnambulist</i> (1970). Gibson, together with his contemporaries like Duane Michals, represented the experimentalism of 1970s American photography, which introduced a viable alternative to postwar humanist photography in France. This rejuvenated avant-gardism was called the &quot;Nouvelle Photographie&quot; among French intellectuals, in reference to the Nouveau Roman in literature and the Nouvelle Vague in cinema. In 1975, Nori published a manifesto in the bulletin <i>Contrejour</i>, identifying sequencing and self-publishing as an effective means to democratize the medium of photography in the spirit of May 1968. For the photographers and critics associated with <i>Contrejour</i>, the photobook and its capacity for storytelling were crucial for updating the medium's engagement with the political reality outside the norms of the documentary tradition.</p>
					<p>By scrutinizing this significant yet largely overlooked chapter in the international history of photography, my paper will theorize the epistemological specificity of the photobook that enabled the subjective reimagination of the photographic truth in the postmodern period.</p>

		    		<h3>F.3.2 <i>Setting the Record Straight: The &quot;Mercury Crisis,&quot; Knowledge Networks, Newspapers, and Photo Essays 1970&ndash;85</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Sarah Watson</strong><span class="school">, Concordia University</span></p>
    				<p>Between 1962 and 1970 a pulp and paper mill dumped 10,000 kilograms of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system in Northwestern Ontario. People from Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation (commonly known as Grassy Narrows), an Ojibwe community on the river, were poisoned and their lives irrevocably changed. A media frenzy ensued, and conflicting narratives and a mass of photographic documentation grew around the &quot;mercury crisis.&quot;</p>
					<p>Oral histories gathered with people of Grassy Narrows in the 1970s, newspaper articles, and scholarship from within Treaty 3 histories and communication studies provide evidence that the federal and Ontario governments minimized the gravity of the mercury poisoning and did not communicate the health risks to the people of Grassy Narrows. The dominant narrative of government obfuscation is well-established. In this paper, I argue that a countervailing narrative and a body of evidence about mercury &mdash; photographic and textual &mdash; was produced and circulated by people working within a hypercomplex network of translocal and transcultural alliances. I posit that a knowledge network of Ojibwe, Japanese, Canadian, and American people was formed with common epistemological objectives; to document, compile, and circulate information about mercury poisoning; to produce narratives and scientific knowledge that corrected the asymmetry of evidence publicly available in Canada at the time. My argument draws on close readings of primary sources produced between 1970 and 1985: photography and texts from Indigenous and regional periodicals, and editorial photo essays produced and circulated within this network. I trace a diachronic trajectory through these documents within the scholarship and histories of Indigenous community newspapers, environmental activism in Canada; and within the shifting status of the high circulation editorial photo essay in the latter part of the twentieth century.</p>

		    		<h3>F.3.2 <i>Counterpower Photography: Documenting the Red Road to DC</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Steve Lyons</strong><span class="school">, Not An Alternative/The Graduate Center, CUNY</span></p>
    				<p>For the last 20 years, the House of Tears Carvers of the Lummi Nation has been carving totem poles, putting them on a flatbed trailer, and bringing them to sites of environmental struggle across the US. At each stop, participants are asked to touch the totem pole &mdash; to give it their power and to receive its power in turn. The goal of the totem pole journeys is to connect communities on the frontlines of environmental struggle, and to build, through the ceremony, a broad and unlikely alliance of people against pipelines &mdash; an insistent &quot;we&quot; that did not previously exist. In the summer of 2021, Lummi carvers and activists teamed up with Not An Alternative/The Natural History Museum and Native Organizers Alliance for their biggest journey yet.</p> 
					<p>The Red Road to DC is a cross-country tour connecting twenty Indigenous-led struggles where sacred lands, waters, and wildlife are imperilled by dams, climate change, and extractive industries: from the Salish Sea to Standing Rock and beyond. Like Lummi's other totem pole journeys, this one was designed to draw a line of connection between communities facing similar threats and a line of division against the extractive relation to land, life, and labour that is driving the world toward extinction. This presentation asks how the photographic documentation of the journey extends this line, arguing for an approach to the image not as a souvenir, historical trace, or resource for study, but as part of the productive process through which collective power is built--as a tool for establishing media narratives, building and representing counterpower, and scaling up lines of solidarity beyond localized sites of struggle.</p>
