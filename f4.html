		    		<p>There is something about the line. The artist's line, and in the case of ledger drawings, the indigenous artist line and the lines on the ledger paper itself. These cool renderings of the indigenous self, culture, life and warfare seem to exist between art, documentation, cultural aesthetics and storytelling. The panel will discuss drawing, first nations art, war art and cultural histories in reference to these 19th-century drawings.</p>

		    		<h3>F.4.1 <i>K&uacute;pi &mdash; They Are Coming Back Here: Centring Lakota Place, History, and Perspective in Ledger Art</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Claire Thomson</strong><span class="school">, University of Alberta</span></p>
    				<p>Two unique examples of Lakota ledger art have long been overlooked for their cultural and historical importance, and their specific connections to experiences and places important to Lakota people ignored. This presentation will examine and contextualize the Goodwyn Ledger Art and a &quot;pictographic drawing&quot; attributed to Chief Sitting Bull, as well as examine the history of Lakota art/artifact collecting that has resulted in the separation of the Lakota community, place, and perspective from them. These pieces are important and unique examples in that they come from a place and historical context that no other Lakota drawings or textual art from the 1870s and 1880s have yet been placed within: &#268;h&aacute;&#331;&#543;e, Wood Mountain (in present-day southern Saskatchewan, Canada), where Lakota people sought safety after the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. The phenomena of collecting Lakota ledger art (and other material culture) for its aesthetic and &quot;Indian&quot; qualities have more often than not removed these pieces physically and culturally from their community and history. This has often meant that the cultural and historical connections were over time forgotten and displaced &mdash; a parallel to the larger settler-colonial agenda of Lakota displacement and dispossession occurring simultaneously. Rekindling these connections can be done, though the longer that these historical documents and art/artifacts are separated from community and context, the more difficult this process can be. The process of starting to make these connections, as well as the barriers to this work, will be explained with the Goodwyn Ledger Art and the Sitting Bull &quot;pictographic drawing.&quot; This can be a possible framework for how we think about other Indigenous art/artifact pieces more generally that have also had their Indigenous perspectives and connections overlooked because they have been removed for generations from the communities and places that created and gave meaning to them.</p>

		    		<h3>F.4.2 <i>T&acirc;pasinahikana: Tellers of Truth</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Gerald McMaster</strong><span class="school">, OCAD University</span></p>
    				<p>I grew up in a Plains Cree (n&ecirc;hiyawak) family that spoke n&ecirc;hiyaw&ecirc;win, and I have always understood the word t&acirc;pasinahik&ecirc; to mean &quot;to draw.&quot; As a child surrounded by farm animals to draw and by comic books that provided artistic inspiration, drawing was a natural thing to do. In preparing for this text, in which I place ledger drawing into a larger context of drawing in general, I felt I didn't need yet another Western definition. Perhaps if I sought out an Indigenous perspective, it might give me entry into new visual knowledge. After consulting a Plains Cree speaker about the etymology of t&acirc;pasinahik&ecirc;, I checked English dictionaries to see if I could find a definition of &quot;draw&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot; &mdash; whether verb or noun &mdash; that could compare to t&acirc;pasinahik&ecirc;'s &quot;to do something in a truthful way.&quot; I could not. This paper will examine the idea of &quot;truthfulness&quot; in drawing and the code by which warrior-artists of the Plains lived and drew.</p>

		    		<h3>F.4.3 <i>Not Where You'd Expect: Ledger Art and Pictographs on Paper</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Sherry Farrell Racette</strong><span class="school">, University of Regina</span></p>
    				<p>The typical art historical narrative of Ledger Art emphasizes Lakota, Cheyenne and Kiowa artists who were transported to Fort Marion, Florida, as prisoners of war. However, pictographs on paper can be found in unexpected places and formats. The 1835&ndash;36 pictographic accounts of Minnesota fur trader Louis Provencalle, a book of ledger drawings created by Hongeeyesa, a Saskatchewan Nakota artist, and the pictographic document of Treaty 4 negotiations created by Chief Pasqua are unexpected works that disrupt our understanding of the scope and purpose of pictographic practices.</p>
