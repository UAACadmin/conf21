		    		<p>Walking has an extensive history as an artistic research practice. Recently artists and scholars have argued that we need practices that break with ableist, racist, extractive, and settler-colonial logics, and instead focus on ones that are situated, relational, and ethical. This has led to question about who gets to walk where, how we walk, where we walk, and what kind of publics we can make. Further, there is a move from individual walking to collective group walking practices that consider the radical relatedness of walking together. Walking research-creation becomes accountable to Indigenous knowledges and sovereignty to Land, considers the geosocial formations of the more-than-human, prioritizes affective subjectivities, and emphasizes movement as a way of knowing. The panel features presentations on anti-racist, anti-colonial, and anti-ableist walking research-creation practices, including the ways walking artist-scholars respond to gathering restrictions during the pandemic.</p>

		    		<h3>C.5.1 <i>Walking Unsettling Depremacy: Stillness, Silence, and Critical Positionalities</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Leah Decter</strong><span class="school">, NSCAD University</span></p>
    				<p>This paper engages with the premise that forging the mutually respectful relations necessary for sustainable decolonial futures (Simpson, 2008, p. 14) requires understandings of place that foreground contemporary Indigenous presence and sovereignty in the context of our everyday movements and spaces, particularly as white settler Canadians who inherently benefit from Indigenous dispossession. In it, I foreground walking methodologies that address TRC Call To Action 45: i, which appeals for &quot;the repudiation of concepts used to justify European sovereignty over Indigenous lands&hellip;&quot; (TRC, 5). In particular, I highlight walking unsettling depremacy as a flexible, place-responsive, inquiry-driven, positionality-based methodology that foregrounds ongoing unsettlement and the decentring of colonial whiteness in relation to embodied interactions with place. This proposition is built upon the convergence of three intersecting elements: an analysis of the ways the Trans Canada Trail's infrastructural and operational systems reiterate colonial claim and walking as recreation can invoke an assumption of &quot;exclusive [Canadian] authority&quot; (Bird and Corntassel, 2018, 196) over Indigenous lands; a discussion of Dylan' Robinson's premise of &quot;critical listening positionality&quot; (Robinson, 2020, 9&ndash;11) as a form of attention in which the normative is accounted for instead of remaining unmarked; and a close reading of my 2020 video, <i>l i s t e n</i>, which, as a refusal of walking, acknowledges land through embodied attention in the form of (my) stillness and silence.</p>

		    		<h3>C.5.2 <i>Marginal Walking and Mapping</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Taien Ng-Chan</strong><span class="school">, York University</span></p>
    				<p>I propose the concept of marginal walking as a critically creative framework that nourishes and supports the spaces of the margins as a corrective and a prescription to the stresses of everyday racism, which is difficult to see or describe, but underlies every interaction in everyday public spaces. Drawing from my reflections on the increase of anti-Asian hate during the global pandemic of 2020&ndash;21, I investigate how news of racist incidents circulates through digital networks that are entangled with quotidian places such as parks, grocery stores, and public transit. Through such concepts as autocartography and strata-mapping, as explored through my own research-creation practices as well as through participatory walks given by my artist collective Hamilton Perambulatory Unit (HPU), I look at how conscious acts of sensing and intervening in marginal everyday space can contribute to the creation of alternative narratives and knowledge that is necessary for change.</p>

		    		<h3>C.5.3 <i>Walking Kepe'k</i></h3>
		    		<p class="presenter"><strong>Barbara Lounder</strong><span class="school">, Independent Scholar</span></p>
    				<p>In the Mi'kmaq language, the word kepe'k means &quot;at the narrows&quot; and is associated with the Narrows in the Halifax Harbour between the Bedford Basin (Asog&ocirc;mapsgiatjg) and the harbour proper (Kjipuktuk). With the span of a spool of thread, it is the narrowest point between Halifax and Dartmouth (Punamu'kwati'jk). An important location in Mi'kmak'i for millennia, Kepe'k figures in many narratives from the past, present, and future. Beginning in 2013, the Dartmouth shore of Kepe'k became an important place for my walking art, research, discovering and sharing truths, and working towards reconciliation. Situated in the edgelands of Dartmouth, Walking Kepe'k gathers stories of Indigenous ways of life and use of resources, Settler contact, conflict and dispossession, the trauma of the 1917 explosion in Halifax Harbour, militarism, and the threats of climate change and sea-level rise that we face now.</p>
						<p>This ongoing work has engaged many Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants. I pay tribute here to my fellow members of NiS+TS (Narratives in Space and Time Society), in particular my partner Robert Bean (who I carry out many collaborations with, including the Being-in-the-Breathable walking art series); Elders, friends and teachers Catherine Martin and Joe Michael; and the many knowledge keepers, researchers, storytellers, artists and other participants who have provided insights and support. In this illustrated presentation, I will map out the process of this work and provide details about the methodologies we developed, such as annotated walks and community collaborations, and how these contributed to the multisensorial, embodied and transformative experiences of Walking Kepe'k.</p>
